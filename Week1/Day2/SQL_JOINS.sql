# SQL Joins – LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN

=======================
  

## LEFT JOIN Queries

--Q1. Display all students and the courses they are enrolled in. Include students who are not enrolled in any course.
>> SELECT s.student_name, c.course_name
   FROM students s
   LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
   LEFT JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id;

--Q2. Find all courses that currently have no students enrolled.
>> SELECT c.course_name
   FROM courses c
   LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON c.course_id = e.course_id
   WHERE e.enrollment_id IS NULL;

--Q3. Display all instructors and the courses they teach, including instructors who are not assigned to any course.
>> SELECT i.instructor_name, c.course_name
   FROM instructors i
   LEFT JOIN courses c ON i.instructor_id = c.instructor_id;

--Q4. Find all courses that do not have an instructor assigned.
>> SELECT course_name
   FROM courses
   WHERE instructor_id IS NULL;

## RIGHT JOIN Queries

--Q5. Display all students and enrollment information using a RIGHT JOIN.
>> SELECT s.student_name, e.enrollment_id, e.course_id, e.enrollment_date
   FROM students s
   RIGHT JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id;

--Q6. Find students who are not enrolled in any course.
>> SELECT s.student_name
   FROM students s
   LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
   WHERE e.enrollment_id IS NULL;

---

## FULL OUTER JOIN Queries

--Q7. Use a FULL OUTER JOIN to display all students and enrollments, including unmatched rows from both tables.
>> SELECT s.student_name, e.enrollment_id, e.course_id, e.enrollment_date
   FROM students s
   LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
   UNION
   SELECT s.student_name, e.enrollment_id, e.course_id, e.enrollment_date
   FROM students s
   RIGHT JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id;

--Q8. Find all courses that have never appeared in the enrollments table.
>> SELECT c.course_name
   FROM courses c
   LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON c.course_id = e.course_id
   WHERE e.course_id IS NULL;

--Q9. Display all instructors and courses using a FULL OUTER JOIN and identify unmatched rows.
>> SELECT i.instructor_name, c.course_name
   FROM instructors i
   LEFT JOIN courses c ON i.instructor_id = c.instructor_id
   UNION
   SELECT i.instructor_name, c.course_name
   FROM instructors i
   RIGHT JOIN courses c ON i.instructor_id = c.instructor_id;

---

## Multi-Table JOIN Queries

--Q10. Create a report showing student name, course name, and instructor name. Include rows even if course or instructor information is missing.
>> SELECT s.student_name, c.course_name, i.instructor_name
   FROM students s
   LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
   LEFT JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
   LEFT JOIN instructors i ON c.instructor_id = i.instructor_id;

---

## Bonus Challenge

--Q11. Write a query that lists every student and every course, even if there is no enrollment relationship between them.
>> SELECT s.student_name, c.course_name
   FROM students s
   CROSS JOIN courses c;
